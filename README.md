Hey there! I'm AJ ðŸ‘‹

- I'm currently focused on learning Go with a focus on backend development and cloud operations.
- While a majority of my projects are private, I'd be happy to discuss them further if you'd like to connect on LinkedIn or GitHub.
- Feel free to reach out - I'm always eager to chat about programming, automation, and any other tech-related topics!
